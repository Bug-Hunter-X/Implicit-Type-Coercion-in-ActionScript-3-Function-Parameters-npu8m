This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in ActionScript 3 related to implicit type coercion when using default parameter values in functions.  The issue arises when only a subset of parameters are provided during a function call, leading to unexpected type conversions and potential runtime errors.  The bug.as file showcases the problem, while bugSolution.as provides a corrected version with explicit type handling to avoid this.
